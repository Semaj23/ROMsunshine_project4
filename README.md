# Sunshine Analysis of Personalized Learning

This repository showcases an analytical dashboard titled **"Sunshine Analysis of Personalized Learning"**, created to deliver actionable insights into learner performance, behavioral patterns, and dropout risks across diverse educational levels and learning styles.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard explores core academic metrics—assignment completion, quiz performance, video engagement, forum participation—alongside demographic and psychographic data to evaluate learner outcomes and retention risk factors.


## Key Insights

- **Overall Average Final Exam Score**: 64.5%
- **Top-Performing Learning Style**: Visual & Reading/Writing
- **Highest Dropout Risk Learning Style**: Reading/Writing
- **Best Performing Education Level**: Postgraduate students
- **Most At-Risk Education Level**: High school students
- **Peak Engagement Window**: 310–409 minutes of video content


## Detailed Analyses

### Assignment Completion vs. Final Exam Scores
Learners with **80–89%** assignment completion scored the highest (65.69%). Performance declines as completion rate drops.

### Forum Participation
Counterintuitively, users with **0–9 posts** on forums had the highest average scores (65.34%), indicating a need to reassess how participation metrics relate to performance.

### Quiz Scores
Final exam performance peaks when quiz scores are in the **80–89%** range, affirming consistent knowledge retention.

### Educational Level Impact
Postgraduates outperform other education levels, suggesting greater academic preparedness or self-discipline.

### Learning Styles
- Top-performing styles: Balanced distribution across all four styles.
- Dropout vulnerability: Reading/Writing learners face the highest attrition rate (26%).

### Time Spent on Videos
Students watching **310–409 minutes** were the most engaged. However, students watching the **most content (410–509 minutes)** had slightly lower performance, hinting at diminishing returns.

### Gender-Based Performance
- **Female**: 64.92%
- **Other**: 64.58%
- **Male**: 63.64%


## Observations

1. **Learning style effectiveness varies by performance and retention**, with Reading/Writing learners being both top performers and most at risk of dropout.
2. **Engagement is not linearly correlated with performance**. Very high content consumption may signal cognitive overload.
3. **Postgraduates benefit more from personalized learning environments**, perhaps due to stronger self-regulation.
4. **Forum activity does not necessarily translate to better academic outcomes**, suggesting alternative engagement strategies may be needed.
5. **Dropout rates are higher in high school learners**, highlighting the need for earlier intervention strategies.


## Recommendations

1. **Targeted Support for At-Risk Groups**: Provide additional support mechanisms (e.g., mentoring, adaptive content) for high school students and Reading/Writing learners.
2. **Optimize Learning Materials**: Tailor video content lengths and styles to avoid disengagement from content fatigue beyond 400+ minutes.
3. **Diversify Engagement Methods**: Implement gamified interactions, peer reviews, and micro-learning modules to complement or replace traditional forum activity.
4. **Refine Learning Analytics**: Track nuanced patterns like self-paced quiz retries or reflective assignments for better learner profiling.
5. **Promote Learning Style Awareness**: Help students identify their most effective style through diagnostics and offer personalized content accordingly.
